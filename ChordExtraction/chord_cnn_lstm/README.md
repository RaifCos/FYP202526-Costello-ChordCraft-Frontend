# ChordCraft - chord-cnn-lstm model implementation 

This code is a refactored implementation of the **chord-cnn-lstm** Automatic Chord Recognition model, sourced from the original repository [here](https://github.com/ptnghia-j/chord-cnn-lstm-model).

## Notable Changes

- Adjusted import statements to maintain original source code dependencies.
- Main `chord_recognition` module is now called by `main()` function and returns its output in JSON format to match other ACR models.
