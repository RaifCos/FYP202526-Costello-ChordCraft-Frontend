# :musical_keyboard: ChordCraft - Frontend Code
ChordCraft is an Android Application built to help users identify chordal features in any audio provided. This project is divided into two main repositories:

- **Frontend Application** (Current Repo)
- **Backend API** ([Link](https://github.com/RaifCos/FYP202526-Costello-ChordCraft-Backend))

## :iphone: Frontend Application
This repository, which formally contained both the backend and frontend code, now contains only the code for the frontend Android application, created through the Android Studio IDE. 

## :round_pushpin: About this Application
